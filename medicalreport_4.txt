HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who presented to the clinic on Tuesday with complaints of increasing fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and difficulty concentrating over the past month. He reported loud snoring as noted by his partner and several episodes of waking up gasping for air. He admitted to poor adherence to his CPAP therapy, citing discomfort with the mask. No recent chest pain, palpitations, or weight changes were reported. The patient was admitted for evaluation and optimization of his OSA management, with Pulmonologist Dr. Chen to follow.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Lives with his wife in Seattle, WA. Works as a truck driver. Non-smoker, drinks beer occasionally on weekends. Enjoys fishing and playing poker.

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT:
During admission, the patient underwent a repeat overnight polysomnography study, which confirmed severe OSA with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 42 events per hour. CPAP therapy was reinitiated with a new mask, and the patient underwent CPAP titration to determine the optimal pressure settings. A sleep hygiene consultation was provided to address bedtime habits. By 08/27/25, the patient reported improved comfort with the new mask and a noticeable decrease in daytime sleepiness. On 08/29/25, he was discharged with a prescription for a CPAP machine with adjusted pressure settings and instructions to follow up with Pulmonology in six weeks to assess adherence and symptom improvement.
