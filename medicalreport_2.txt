HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension who presented to the Emergency Department on Sunday with complaints of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough with yellowish sputum, and low-grade fever over the past four days. He also reported decreased exercise tolerance and wheezing. The patient denied chest pain or hemoptysis. He had been non-compliant with his prescribed inhalers due to financial difficulties. Initial evaluation showed hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. He was admitted for management of an acute COPD exacerbation, with Pulmonologist Dr. Jacobs to follow.

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT:
During admission, the patient was started on a combination of nebulized albuterol/ipratropium every 4 hours, IV methylprednisolone 40 mg q.d., and a 5-day course of azithromycin for suspected bacterial infection. Supplemental oxygen was provided via nasal cannula at 2 L/min. Chest X-ray revealed hyperinflation but no evidence of pneumonia. Pulmonary function tests were deferred until outpatient follow-up. By 03/05/25, the patient demonstrated improved respiratory status, with reduced coughing and wheezing. On 03/07/25, he was discharged home on oral prednisone taper, a new prescription for tiotropium, and instructions to follow up in the pulmonology clinic in two weeks. A social worker was consulted to assist with access to medication programs to improve adherence.
