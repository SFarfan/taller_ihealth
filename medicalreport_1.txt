HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of migraine with aura and generalized anxiety disorder who presented to the clinic on Tuesday with complaints of a new onset of daily headaches over the past two weeks. She described the headaches as a dull, pressure-like sensation, bilateral, and without associated nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or sound. She noted that the headaches tend to worsen as the day progresses and are accompanied by jaw discomfort. She recently started a new job requiring prolonged desk work. Neurologist Dr. Patel was consulted, and the patient was admitted for further evaluation of chronic tension-type headaches and to rule out other secondary causes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Lives with her partner in Dallas, TX. Works as a paralegal. Non-smoker, drinks coffee daily but denies alcohol use. Enjoys reading and cooking.

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT:
During admission, the patient was evaluated by Neurology, Dr. Patel, and started on amitriptyline 10 mg PO q.d. for headache prevention. Imaging studies, including an MRI of the brain, were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed significant tenderness in the temporalis and masseter muscles, suggesting temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction. She was referred to a dentist specializing in TMJ disorders. Stress management techniques, including progressive muscle relaxation, were introduced. By 07/17/25, the patient reported reduced headache intensity and improved understanding of her condition. On 07/18/25, she was discharged with a plan to continue amitriptyline, pursue TMJ treatment, and follow up in the neurology clinic in six weeks.
