Date: 09/07/24

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of asthma and seasonal allergies who presented to the clinic on Saturday with complaints of a persistent cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath over the past 10 days. She stated that her symptoms worsened at night, interfering with sleep. The patient reported using her albuterol inhaler more frequently than usual, with minimal relief. She also described mild chest tightness but denied fever or recent upper respiratory infections. The patient was referred for admission for further evaluation and treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation, with Pulmonologist Dr. Singh to follow.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Lives with her husband in Milwaukee, WI. Works as an elementary school librarian. Non-smoker, rarely drinks alcohol. Enjoys knitting and walking her dog.

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT:
During admission, the patient was seen by Pulmonology, Dr. Singh, and was started on a regimen of IV corticosteroids, nebulized albuterol every 4 hours, and supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 L/min. A chest X-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia. Spirometry confirmed moderate airflow obstruction consistent with her asthma history. By 09/09/24, the patient reported significant improvement in symptoms and was weaned off supplemental oxygen. On 09/11/24, the patient was discharged home with a tapering dose of prednisone, a prescription for a long-acting bronchodilator (Symbicort 160/4.5, 2 puffs b.i.d.), and instructions to follow up in the pulmonology clinic in two weeks.
