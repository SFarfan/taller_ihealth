HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 46-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and hypothyroidism who presented to the clinic on Wednesday with complaints of worsening joint pain and swelling in her hands, knees, and ankles over the past month. She reported morning stiffness lasting over an hour and noted increased difficulty with daily activities, such as typing and walking. The patient has been non-compliant with her methotrexate due to concerns about side effects. She denied fever, rash, or new symptoms. Rheumatologist Dr. Kapoor was consulted, and the patient was admitted for management of a rheumatoid arthritis flare.

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT:
During admission, the patient was seen by Rheumatology, Dr. Kapoor, and started on IV methylprednisolone 40 mg q.d. for three days, followed by a tapering dose of oral prednisone. Methotrexate therapy was reinitiated at a lower dose (7.5 mg PO weekly) with folic acid supplementation. Labs revealed elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP), consistent with disease activity. X-rays showed no new erosive changes. By 04/20/25, the patient experienced significant improvement in joint pain and mobility. On 04/22/25, she was discharged home with instructions to continue methotrexate and follow up in the rheumatology clinic in four weeks for further assessment and potential addition of a biologic agent.
