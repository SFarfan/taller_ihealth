The patient is a 28-year-old woman with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obesity who presented to the clinic on Monday with complaints of irregular menstrual cycles, increased facial hair growth, and persistent weight gain over the past six months despite dietary changes and increased physical activity. She also reported occasional mood swings and fatigue. The patient denied headaches, vision changes, or galactorrhea. Laboratory tests from her primary care physician showed elevated serum testosterone levels and mildly increased fasting glucose. Endocrinologist Dr. Reynolds was consulted, and the patient was admitted for comprehensive evaluation and management of PCOS-related metabolic dysfunction.

During admission, the patient was evaluated by Endocrinology, Dr. Reynolds, and started on metformin 500 mg PO b.i.d. for insulin resistance. A transvaginal ultrasound confirmed multiple ovarian follicles consistent with PCOS. She was counseled on weight management strategies, including a referral to a dietitian and enrollment in a supervised exercise program. Spironolactone 50 mg PO q.d. was initiated to manage androgenic symptoms. By 12/14/25, the patient expressed a better understanding of her condition and was motivated to follow the recommended plan. On 12/15/25, she was discharged with instructions to follow up in the endocrinology clinic in six weeks for progress evaluation and potential adjustment of medications.
