HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 34-year-old woman with a history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and anxiety who presented to the clinic on Monday with complaints of worsening abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea over the past two weeks. She reported that the symptoms began after a recent stressful work event and were associated with intermittent nausea and fatigue. The patient denied fever, weight loss, or rectal bleeding. Previous dietary modifications and over-the-counter antispasmodics provided minimal relief. She was referred for admission for hydration, symptom control, and evaluation for potential flare or complications related to IBS. Gastroenterologist Dr. Lin was consulted.

SOCIAL HISTORY:

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT:
During admission, the patient was seen by Gastroenterology, Dr. Lin, and started on IV fluids for rehydration and a low-FODMAP diet. Lab work, including stool studies, ruled out infectious causes. Abdominal ultrasound and CT imaging were unremarkable. The patient was treated with hyoscyamine for cramping and loperamide for diarrhea control. By 06/04/25, her symptoms had improved significantly, and she was tolerating oral intake. On 06/06/25, she was discharged home with a prescription for rifaximin 550 mg PO b.i.d. for two weeks, instructions to continue the low-FODMAP diet, and follow-up with her gastroenterologist in four weeks.
